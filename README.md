# Blackjack
A little blackjack game I'm working on for my website.  I wanted to practice my javascript and my friend wanted to practice his blackjack.

## Scoreboard
The Scoreboard uses a MySQL server to store the values.  PHP is used to update the database and retrieve scores.  Javascript uses AJAX to integrate it into the game real-time.

## Gameplay
The gameplay follows pretty standard rules however no Insurance.  There is a maximum amount of splits (2 splits/3 hands; it's hard to fit more hands and have it look good).  Player always wins on blackjack, dealer blackjack beats player's 21.
